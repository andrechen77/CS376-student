This game is a single-player Rocket League-inspired game.

The player controls a red car on screen. The player should use the red car to hit the white ball into the green goals; hitting a green goal will destroy it and spawn a new one. The green goals spawn progressively smaller with each goal.

# Time to Death

The player has a time to death, which is the amount of time they have remaining before they die. The following are the ways that the time to death can change:
- scoring into a goal rewards 10 seconds of survival time
- hitting the ball or a wall penalizes 1 second of survival time
When the survival time reaches zero, the player loses.

# Winning

To win, the player must hit enough goals to reduce the size of the goal to nothing. Upon reaching this condition, the remaining time to death is the player's final score.

# Controls

The player can be controlled using the mouse; pressing Fire1 (Ctrl or left mouse button) will cause the player to turn toward and accelerate toward the mouse.

For an extra challenge, the player can also be controlled with the keyboard/joystick; in this case the Horizontal axis rotates the player and the Vertical axis accelerates the player forward/backward.

The player has a dash action, triggered by Fire2 (LAlt or right mouse button), which causes them to dash forward into their current heading. The dash must recharge once it is used; it takes 2 seconds to fully charge. A fully charged dash will completely replace the player's current velocity with a forward dash. If the player dashes when not fully charged, the current velocity will only be slightly attenuated, and the dash will be weaker.

The player may also brake using Fire3 (Shift or middle mouse button).

Esc will reset the level

# Sounds

A crash sound plays when the player hits something, a laser sound plays on dashing, and a beep plays when the player scores a goal.
